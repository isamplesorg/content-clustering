# content-clustering

Experimenting with clustering methods on different collections. 

*Initial experiments with 1% of data are in 'experiment with 1% of sample data'

*2nd round of experiments with 100% of data for each sample collection are in their respective folder: SESAR, OPENCONTEXT, etc. Data are not pushed to the repo due to the size limit.
